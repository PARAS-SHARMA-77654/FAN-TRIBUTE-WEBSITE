                    tells the profound story of Shoya Ishida and Shoko Nishimiya—a journey from

                    forgiveness, and the human need for connection.

                            <p>
                                In elementary school, Shoya Ishida was a reckless boy who sought entertainment 
                                at any cost. When Shoko Nishimiya, a deaf girl, transferred to his class, 
                                she became the target of his cruel bullying. What started as thoughtless 
                                teasing escalated into relentless torment, eventually leading to Shoko's 
                                transfer to another school.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But karma arrived swiftly. When Shoko left, Shoya became the new target. 
                                His former friends turned on him, and he spent the rest of his school years 
                                as an outcast, carrying the weight of his actions like chains.
                            </p>

                            <h3>The Reunion</h3>
                            <p>
                                Years later, as a high school student, Shoya is consumed by guilt and 
                                self-loathing. He has decided to tie up loose ends before ending his life. 
                                He learns sign language and seeks out Shoko to return her notebook and 
                                apologize for his past cruelty.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Their reunion is awkward, painful, and unexpected. Shoko, rather than 
                                rejecting him, responds with kindness—even friendship. This simple act 
                                of forgiveness becomes the catalyst that saves Shoya's life and sets 
                                both of them on a journey toward healing.

                            <p>
                                As Shoya and Shoko navigate their complicated friendship, they're joined 
                                by a cast of characters from their past—each carrying their own scars and 
                                guilt. Together, they confront the lingering pain of what happened years ago.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Through fireworks festivals, film projects, and honest confrontations, 
                                they learn that forgiveness—both of others and of oneself—is not a 
                                destination but a continuous journey. The film culminates in a powerful 
                                moment of acceptance, where Shoya finally allows himself to reconnect 
                                with the world around him.

                        <p>
                            The soundtrack composed by <strong>Kensuke Ushio</strong> (also known as agraph) 
                            is a masterclass in emotional storytelling through music. Rather than relying 
                            on sweeping orchestral pieces, Ushio created an intimate, experimental score 
                            that perfectly mirrors the film's vulnerable atmosphere.

                        <p>
                            Throughout the film, Shoya sees X marks on people's faces—a visual 
                            metaphor for his isolation and inability to connect. As he begins to 
                            forgive himself and open up, these X marks gradually fall away in one 
                            of anime's most powerful visual sequences.

                        <p>
                            The film beautifully incorporates Japanese Sign Language (JSL) as a 
                            central element, with careful attention to authentic representation. 
                            The animators studied JSL extensively to portray it accurately and 
                            respectfully.

                            Director Naoko Yamada frequently films from lower angles, focusing 
                            on feet and legs. This unique perspective creates intimacy and 
                            emphasizes the characters' emotional states through body language 
                            rather than just facial expressions.

                            Water appears as a recurring motif—representing both danger and 
                            purification. The river scenes, reflections, and the crucial bridge 
                            location all carry deep symbolic meaning in the characters' journey.

                            The film uses Japan's distinct seasons to mark the passage of time 
                            and emotional growth. From cherry blossoms to fireworks to autumn 
                            leaves, each season reflects the characters' inner transformations.

                            tones during Shoya's darkest moments to vibrant, warm colors as he 
                            begins to heal and reconnect with life.
